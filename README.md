# Codebook-2

Codebook 2 is the second iteration of my programmable stack-based (RPN) CLI calculator. It essentially has its own (unnamed) interpreted scripting language 
that's used to write functions and interact with the stack. **Disclaimer: I am not formally trained on how to program in Rust, nor do I have
a background in compilers, file-lexing, etc.; this is a personal project I made in my free time. I do not have time to dedicate to bug-fixing or
adding new features.**
